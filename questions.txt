1. Describe two of the following Python features as you would to a CS Grad learning Python. 
	a. generators 
	b. decorators 
	c. list/dict comprehension, 
	d. the collections, itertools, or functools module 

a. Generator functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, i.e. it can be used in a for loop
c. List comprehension is basically clubbing the for and append for a list in one statement.

2. What are your favorite and least favorite Python features?

Least favourite is the lack of multi-line comments and the indentation feature.
I like Python's simplicity.
